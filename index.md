## About Me

I'm an aspiring web developer/software engineer/programmer located in Boise, ID.

Third-year computer science student at Boise State University.

I specialize in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Node.js. I also have experience working with nginx, and I love finding ways to squeeze out every bit of performance possible.

### Code Examples

Here are some of the projects I've done, mostly using web technologies. All examples are hosted here on my website. First proxied through Cloudflare, and then reverse-proxied through nginx to be served through Node.js. All pages are served with full SSL encryption. The calendar and ISC demos use websockets for instant updates.

To login to the ISC management demo, use pin "1234".
